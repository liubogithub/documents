Data means a lot to every business. To maintain or fit requirements from the
data storage, IT organization must learn to manage data storage effectively.
The most common case in the world is that data growth results in seperate
copies of the same data with disparate users, where storage system deduplication
technology can offer a great increase in storage efficiency with saving the
cost. Generally, data deduplication is a specialized form of data compression
technique, typically to improve storage utilization. As btrfs has a good
infrastructure to fit shared data by naturally supported block back-reference,
this'd be a good start for data deduplication. This talk will show how to
implement a btrfs specific data deduplication and how practical it is. For this
session, there'd be some filesystem specific content, so for the target
audience, it'd be better to have a basic knowledge base of filesystem.
